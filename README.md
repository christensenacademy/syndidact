##Questioning Assumptions and Taking New Perspectives

The current system of education and the underlying model it's built on are so ingrained in our thinking about education that it can be very different to envision anything new. Education is the bedrock of our society. It's very presence pervades our lives. Imagining it working a different way is not easy, yet that's exactly what I'm asking you to do. I don't claim to have answers or solutions to the problems, but I do claim to have some fresh perspectives and new ideas I'd like to share. Ultimately, I hope to get you thinking about education in a new way that calls into question many of our age-old assumptions about the way education should work.

Because I want to help you engage with the same ideas I've been grappling with over the past 18 months, and because I have little interest in trying to tell people what to think, I'll be presenting ideas around genuine questions. I've tried hard to make each question authentic in that I'm not prescribing a correct answer. I hope the tone of the book is one of humility and joy. I've had a really fun time tackling these questions on my own, and I hope you will feel similarly.
